  "Understand how to read a recursive definition, e.g. compute selected values or objects produced by that definition.",
  "Know that a recursive definition requires both a base case (or cases) and a recursive step/formula.",
  "Define the Fibonacci numbers.",
  "Know the definition of the k-dimensional hypercube graph, its shorthand name Q k , and how many vertices and edgesit contains. Unrolling Given a recursively defined function, find its closed form by unrolling. Test questions will involve either doing certain key steps or a very simple example, not an entire long messy unrolling.",
  "Write inductive proofs that need to use the truth of the claim for more than one immediately previous value, e.g. multiple previous values, a previous value several steps back.",
  "Determine whether an inductive proof requires more than one base case and, if so, which ones.",
  "Use induction to prove facts about a recursively defined function, e.g. that it has some specific closed form.",
  "Use induction to prove (fairly simple) properties for objects such as graphs and strings."
