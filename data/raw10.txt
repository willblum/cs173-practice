1. (7 points)
You found the following claim on a hallway whiteboard. Suppose that f and g are
increasing functions from the reals to the reals, for which all output values are > 1. If f(x) is
O(g(x)), then log(f(x)) is O(log(g(x))). Is this true? Brieﬂy justify your answer.
2. (8 points) Check the (single) box that best characterizes each item.
T(1) = d
T(n) = 2T(n −1) + c
Θ(log n)
Θ(√n)
Θ(n)
Θ(n log n)
Θ(n2)
Θ(n3)
Θ(2n)
Θ(3n)
T(1) = d
T(n) = T(n −1) + n
Θ(log n)

n1.5 is
Θ(n1.414)
O(n1.414)
neither of these
Suppose f(n) is Θ(g(n)).
Will g(n) be O(f(n))?
no
sometimes
yes
