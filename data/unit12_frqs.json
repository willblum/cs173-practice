    "solution": "This is an unordered sampling with replacement problem ('stars and bars'). We need to drop 10 stripes (stars) into 3 color buckets (requiring 2 bars). The total arrangements are (10 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1), which is 12 choose 2. 12! / (10! 2!) = (12 \u00d7 11) / 2 = 66 ways.",

    "solution": "Proof by Cantor's Diagonalization. Assume for contradiction the set is countable. We can list the infinite strings in a sequence: s_1, s_2, s_3, ... Construct a new infinite binary string x where the i-th bit of x is the logic flipped bit of the i-th bit of s_i. The string x is an infinite binary string, but it cannot be anywhere in our sequence, because it differs from every string s_k at the k-th position. This contradicts the assumption that all strings were listed. Thus, the set is uncountable. \u25A1",
