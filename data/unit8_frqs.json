    "claim": "Suppose that f: \u2124\u207a \u2192 \u2124 is defined by f(1) = 5, f(2) = -5, and f(n) = 4f(n-2) - 3f(n-1) for all n \u2265 3. Use (strong) induction to prove that f(n) = 2 \u00d7 (-4)^{n-1} + 3.",
    "solution": "Base cases: n=1: f(1) = 2(-4)^0 + 3 = 2+3 = 5. n=2: f(2) = 2(-4)^1 + 3 = -8+3 = -5. IH: Assume f(j) = 2(-4)^{j-1} + 3 for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, where k \u2265 2. Step: We must show f(k+1) matches the formula. f(k+1) = 4f(k-1) - 3f(k). Substitute IH: 4[2(-4)^{k-2} + 3] - 3[2(-4)^{k-1} + 3]. distribute: 8(-4)^{k-2} + 12 - 6(-4)^{k-1} - 9. = -2(-4)^{k-1} - 6(-4)^{k-1} + 3. = -8(-4)^{k-1} + 3. Notice that -8(-4)^{k-1} = 2 \u00d7 (-4) \u00d7 (-4)^{k-1} = 2(-4)^k. Thus f(k+1) = 2(-4)^k + 3. \u25A1",

    "claim": "Use (strong) induction to prove that the following claim holds: For any integer n \u2265 2, if p_1, \u2026, p_n is a sequence of integers and p_1 < p_n, then there is an index j (1 \u2264 j < n) such that p_j < p_{j+1}.",
    "solution": "Induction on n. Base case n=2: The sequence is p_1, p_2 with p_1 < p_2. So j=1 satisfies p_j < p_{j+1}. IH: Assume the claim is true for sequences of length 2 up to k. Step (length k+1 sequence: p_1, \u2026, p_{k+1} where p_1 < p_{k+1}): Choose an intermediate element p_m where 1 < m < k+1. If p_m > p_{k+1}, then p_1 < p_{k+1} < p_m, meaning p_1 < p_m. By IH on the first m elements, there exists an index satisfying the property. If p_m \u2264 p_{k+1}, then we can apply IH on the suffix subset p_m \u2026 p_{k+1} to find our index. In either case, the local drop exists. \u25A1",
