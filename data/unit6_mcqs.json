    "explanation": "Looking at typical SP19 versions of this graph, there's usually a central rectangular cycle and a couple triangular ones. The key is manually tracing individual independent cycles. To compute accurately, you count the basic bounded faces. The answer varies by version, but a typical 2-joined-triangle with a tail has exactly 3 cycles (the two small ones and the large outer one).",
