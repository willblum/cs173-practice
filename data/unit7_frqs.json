    "solution": "Proof by induction on n. Base cases: n=8: p=1, q=1. n=9: p=3, q=0. n=10: p=0, q=2. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume n = 3p + 5q for all j up to k, where k \u2265 10. Inductive step: We must show k+1 can be written as 3p + 5q. Consider (k+1) - 3 = k-2. Since k \u2265 10, k-2 \u2265 8. By the IH, k-2 = 3p' + 5q' for some non-negative p', q'. Therefore, k+1 = (k-2) + 3 = 3(p'+1) + 5q'. Thus we have found valid coefficients p = p'+1 and q = q'. \u25A1",

    "solution": "Base case n=1: LHS: 1/(1(2)) = 1/2. RHS: 1/(1+1) = 1/2. LHS=RHS. IH: Assume the formula holds for n=k. Inductive step: Prove for n=k+1. \u2211(from 1 to k+1) = (\u2211(from 1 to k)) + 1/((k+1)(k+2)). Apply IH: k/(k+1) + 1/((k+1)(k+2)). Find common denominator (k+1)(k+2). Numerator becomes k(k+2) + 1 = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2. Fraction becomes (k+1)^2 / ((k+1)(k+2)) = (k+1)/(k+2). This matches the RHS target for k+1. \u25A1",

    "instruction": "Divides induction proof.",
    "claim": "Working directly from the definition of divides, use induction to prove: n^3 + 5n is divisible by 6, for all positive integers n.",
    "solution": "Base Case: n=1: 1^3 + 5(1) = 6. 6 is divisible by 6 (6=6*1). IH: Assume k^3 + 5k = 6m for some integer m, for an arbitrary positive integer k. Step: We want to show (k+1)^3 + 5(k+1) = 6j. Expands to (k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) + 5k + 5 = (k^3 + 5k) + 3k^2 + 3k + 6. By IH, substitute 6m: 6m + 3k(k+1) + 6. Notice k(k+1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it must be even (2p). Thus 3k(k+1) = 3(2p) = 6p. Substitute back: 6m + 6p + 6 = 6(m+p+1). Since m, p, 1 are integers, m+p+1 is an integer, so 6 divides the expression. \u25A1",
