(18 points) A Borg tree is a full binary tree whose nodes contain integers such that
• Every leaf contains the value 0.
• The value v(X) in a node X is (strictly) larger than the values in X’s children.
Use (strong) induction to prove that the value in the root of a Borg tree is larger than the value in
any other node of the tree.
The induction variable is named
and it is the
of/in the tree.
Base Case(s):
Inductive Hypothesis [Be speciﬁc, don’t just refer to “the claim”]:
