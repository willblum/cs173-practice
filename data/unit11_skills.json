  "Know the big-O running times of basic operations on linked lists and arrays. These include reading/writing values, adding/removing elements, and dividing the list/array at locations at/near the start, in the middle, and at the end. Be familiar with the overall structure and big-O running times of the following algorithms. merge two sorted lists",
  "graph reachability (what's in x's connected component)",
  "Be familiar with the overall structure and big-O running times of the following algorithms. Towers of Hanoi solver Karatsuba's algorithm (you won't have to reproduce all the details)",
  "Find a big-O solution for slightly harder recursive definitions than the ones for examlet 10, e.g. requiring use of the change of base formula. Given an unfamiliar but fairly simple function in pseudo-code, analyze how long it takes using big-O notation. You should be able to analyze nested for loops, recursive functions, and simple examples of while loops.",
  "For an algorithm involving loops (perhaps nested), express its running time using summations.",
  "Given a recursive algorithm (familiar or unfamiliar) express its running time as a recursive definition."
