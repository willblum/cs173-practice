Suppose that S is the set of all binary strings (i.e. ﬁnite sequences of 1’s and 0’s).
Suppose that ∼is the relation on S where a ∼b if and only if a and b contain the same number of
1’s. For example, 0101 ∼1000001. List three members of [111].
3. (5 points) Let T be the relation deﬁned on set of pairs (x, y) ∈R2 such that (x, y)T(p, q) if and
only if x ≤p or y ≤q. Is T antisymmetric? Informally explain why it is, or give a concrete
counter-example showing that it is not.

2. (5 points) A relation is a partial order if it has which three properties? (Naming the properties is
suﬃcient. You don’t have to deﬁne them.)
3. (5 points) Suppose that R is a relation on the integers such that xRy for all integers x and y. Is
R an equivalence relation?

2. (5 points) Let’s deﬁne the equivalence relation ∼on N3 such that (x, y, z) ∼(p, q, r) if and only
(x, y, z) = α(p, q, r) for some integer α. List three members of [(1, 2, 3)] List three elements that
are related to (1, 2, 3) in either direction.
3. (5 points) Suppose that R is the relation on the set of integers such that aRb if and only if
|a −b| ≤13 Is R transitive?
Informally explain why it is, or give a concrete counter-example
showing that it is not.

Let T be a reﬂexive relation deﬁned on the integers. Let S be the relation on the
integers such that aSb if and only if there is an integer k such that aTk and kTb. Is S reﬂexive?
(I.e. is S reﬂexive for any reﬂexive relation T?) Informally explain why it is, or give a concrete
counter-example showing that it is not.

A relation is an equivalence relation if it has which three properties? (Naming the
properties is suﬃcient. You don’t have to deﬁne them.)
3. (5 points) Suppose that ⪰is the relation between subsets of the integers such that A ⪰B if and
only if A −B ̸= ∅. (A and B are sets of integers, so A −B is a set diﬀerence.) Is ⪰transitive?
Informally explain why it’s true or give a concrete counter-example.
