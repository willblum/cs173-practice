Claim : For any integer n ≥2, if p1, . . . , pn is a sequence of integers and p1 < pn, then there
is an index j (1 ≤j < n) such that pj < pj+1.

(20 points) Suppose that θ is a constant (but unknown) real number. For any real number p, the
angle addition formulas imply the following two equations (which you can assume without proof):
cos(θ) cos(pθ)
=
cos((p + 1)θ) + sin(θ) sin(pθ)
(1)
cos(θ) cos(pθ)
=
cos((p −1)θ) −sin(θ) sin(pθ)
(2)
Suppose that f : Z+ →Z is deﬁned by
f(0) = 1
f(1) = cos(θ)
f(n + 1) = 2 cos(θ)f(n) −f(n −1), for all n ≥2.
Use (strong) induction to prove that f(n) = cos(nθ) for any natural number n.
Proof by induction on n.

(20 points) A Zellig graph consists of 2n (n ≥1) nodes connected so as to form a circle. Half of the
nodes have label 1 and the other half have label -1. As you move clockwise around the circle, you keep
a running total of node labels. E.g. if you start at a 1 node and then pass through two -1 nodes, your
running total is -1. Use (strong) induction to prove that there is a choice of starting node for which the
running total stays ≥0.
Hint: remove an adjacent pair of nodes.
Proof by induction on n.
