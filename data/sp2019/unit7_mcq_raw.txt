1. (11 points) If G is a graph, recall that χ(G) is its chromatic number. Suppose that G is a graph
with at least one edge and H is another graph with at least one edge, not connected to G. Now,
pick a speciﬁc edge e from G and an edge f from H and merge the two edges, creating a combined
graph T. For example, suppose that G is C5 and H is K4. Then T might look as follows, where g
marks nodes of G and h marks nodes of H.
