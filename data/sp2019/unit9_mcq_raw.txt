1. (8 points) Consider the following grammar G, with start symbol S and terminals a and b.
S
→
a S a | b S b | a S b | b S a | a | b
Amy claims that this generates all non-empty strings containing a’s and/or b’s. Is this correct?
Justify your answer.

Consider the following grammar G
S →S b S | a | c d
S is the only start symbol. The terminal symbols are a, b, c, and d.
Here are two sequences of leaf labels. For each sequence, either draw a tree from grammar G whose
leaves have this sequence of labels, or else explain brieﬂy why G cannot generate this sequence of
leaf labels.

1. (8 points) Min’s virus detection code needs to generate all strings of the form anbn. That is, all
strings that consist of a sequence of one or more a’s followed by the same number of b’s. Write a
context-free grammar G that will do this.
