Let’s deﬁne a relation T between natural numbers follows:
aTb if and only if a = b + 2k, where k is a natural number
Working directly from this deﬁnition, prove that T is antisymmetric.

A closed interval of the real line can be represented as a pair (c, r), where c is the center of the interval
and r is its radius. Let X = {(c, r) | c, r ∈R, r ≥0} be the set of closed intervals represented this way.
Now, let’s deﬁne the interval containment ⪯on X as follows
(c, r) ⪯(d, q) if and only if r ≤q and |c −d| + r ≤q.
Prove that ⪯is transitive.

Suppose that T is a relation on the integers which is transitive. Let’s deﬁne a relation R on the
integers as follows:
xRy if and only if there is an integer k such that xTk and kTy.
Prove that R is transitive.
