Working directly from the deﬁnition of divides, use (strong) induction to prove the
following claim:
Claim: n3 + 5n is divisible by 6, for all positive integers n.
Proof by induction on n.

(15 points) The operator Q is like P except that it multiplies its terms rather than adding them.
So e.g. Q5
p=3(p + 1) = 4 · 5 · 6. Use (strong) induction to prove the following claim:
Qn
p=2(1 −1
p2) = n+1
2n for any integer n ≥2.
Proof by induction on n.
