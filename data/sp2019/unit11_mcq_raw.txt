Fill in the missing bits of a recursive implementation of Merge, which merges two lists
of integers sorted in increasing order. Use the functions ﬁrst (ﬁrst element), rest (everything after ﬁrst
element), and and cons (adds number to list).
Merge(L1,L2: sorted lists of real numbers)
if (L1 is empty and L2 is empty) return emptylist
else if (L2 is empty or ﬁrst(L1) <= ﬁrst(L2))
