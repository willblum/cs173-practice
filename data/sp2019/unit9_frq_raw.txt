(18 points) A Mouse tree is a binary tree containing 2D points such that:
• Each leaf node contains (3, 1), (−2, −5), or (2, 2).
• An internal node with one child labelled (a, b) has label (a + 1, b −1).
• An internal node with two childen labelled (x, y) and (a, b) has label (x + a, y + b).
Use (strong) induction to prove that the point in the root node of any Mouse tree is on or below the
line x = y.
The induction variable is named
and it is the
of/in the tree.

(18 points) A palindrome is a string that is the same if you reverse it. For example, abbabba and
abaaba are palindromes. The empty (zero-length) string ǫ counts as a palindrome.
Here is a grammar G, with start symbol S and terminal symbols a and b.
S
→
a S a | b S b | a | b | ǫ
Use (strong) induction to prove that any palindrome made out of characters a and b can be generated
by grammar G. That is, show how to build parse trees for these strings. Hint: remove the ﬁrst and last
character from the string.
The induction variable is named
and it is the
of/in the string.

(18 points) Recall that a node in a full binary tree must have either 0 or 2 children. A Shark tree is
a full binary tree in which each node is colored orange or blue, such that:
• If v is a leaf node, then v is colored orange.
• If v has two children of the same color, then v is colored blue.
• If v has two children of diﬀerent colors, then v is colored orange.
Use (strong) induction to show that the root of a Shark tree is blue if and only if the tree has an even
number of leaves. You may assume basic divisibility facts e.g. the sum of two odd numbers is even.
The induction variable is named
and it is the
of/in the tree.

(18 points) A Horse tree is a binary tree whose nodes contain integers such that
• Every leaf node contains 5, 17, or 23.
• A node with one child contains the same number as its child.
• A node with two children contains the value x(y + 1), where x and y are the values in its children.
Use strong induction to prove that the value in the root of a Horse tree is always positive.
The induction variable is named
and it is the
of/in the tree.

Use (strong) induction to prove that any tree matching (aka generated by) grammar G has an even
number of leaves if and only if its root has label N.

(18 points) Recall that a node in a full binary tree is either a leaf or has exactly two children. A
Possum tree is a full binary tree whose leaves are all orange and whose root is blue.
Use (strong) induction to prove that a Possum tree contains a blue node with (at least) one orange
child.
The induction variable is named
and it is the
