(15 points) Use proof by contrapositive to prove the following claim, using your best mathematical
style and working directly from the deﬁnitions of “odd” and “even.” (You may assume that odd and
even are opposites.)
For all integers p and q, if p2(q2 −4) is odd, then p and q are odd.
You must begin by explicitly stating the contrapositive of the claim:

(15 points) Prove the following claim, using your best mathematical style and the following deﬁnition
of congruence mod k:
x ≡y (mod k) if and only if x = y + nk for some integer n.
For all integers x, y, p, q and m, with m > 0, if x ≡p (mod m) and y ≡q (mod m), then
x2 + xy ≡p2 + pq (mod m).

For any two real numbers x and y, the harmonic mean is H(x, y) =
2xy
x+y. Using this
deﬁnition and your best mathematical style, prove the following claim:
For any real numbers x and y, if 0 < x < y, then H(x, y) < y.

(15 points) Recall that a real number p is rational if there are integers m and n (n non-zero) such
that p =
m
n .
Use this deﬁnition and your best mathematical style to prove the following claim by
contrapositive.
For all real numbers x and y, if x is not rational, then 2x + 3y is not rational or y is not
rational.
You must begin by explicitly stating the contrapositive of the claim:

A triple (a, b, c) of positive integers is Pythagorean if a2 + b2 = c2.
Use proof by
contrapositive to prove the following claim, using your best mathematical style and working directly
from the deﬁnitions of “odd” and “even.” (You may assume that odd and even are opposites.)
For any Pythagorean triple (a, b, c), if c2 is odd, then a is even or b is even.
You must begin by explicitly stating the contrapositive of the claim:
