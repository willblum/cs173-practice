1. (8 points) Suppose we have a function g deﬁned by
g(0)
=
g(1) = c
g(n)
=
kg(n −2) + n2, for n ≥2
where k and c are constants. Express g(n) in terms of g(n −6) (where n ≥6). Show your work
and simplify your answer. You do not need to ﬁnd a closed form for g(n).
2. (2 points) Suppose that f : N →N is such that f(n) = n!. Give a recursive deﬁnition of f

Express f(n) in terms of f(n −3) (where n ≥4). Show your work and simplify your answer. You
do not need to ﬁnd a closed form for f(n).
2. (2 points) Suppose that G0 is the graph consisting of a single vertex. Also suppose that the graph
Gn consists of a copy of Gn−1 plus an extra vertex v and edges joining v to each vertex in Gn−1.
Give a clear picture or precise description of G4.
