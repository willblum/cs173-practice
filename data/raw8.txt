(20 points) Recall that Fn is the nth Fibonacci number, and these start with F0 = 0, F1 = 1. Use
(strong) induction to prove the following claim:
Claim: Fn < (5/3)n for any natural number n.
Proof by induction on n.
Base case(s):
Inductive Hypothesis [Be speciﬁc, don’t just refer to “the claim”]:

(10 points) Suppose we have a function F deﬁned (for n a power of 2) by
F(2)
=

F(n)
=
F(n/2) + n for n ≥4
Your partner has already ﬁgured out that
F(n) = F(n/2k) +
