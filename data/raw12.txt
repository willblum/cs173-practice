Donald Knuth has proposed a replacement for conventional resistor codes. In the new
system, each resistor has 10 stripes. Each stripe can be either red, blue, or green. The type of resistor
is determined by the total amount of each color. E.g. two resistors with 4 red, 5 blue, and 1 green are
the same, regardless of the order in which those stripes appear. How many diﬀerent types of resistor can
this code represent?
Brieﬂy justify your answer and/or show work.

There is a relish r such that r is orange but r is not spicy.
