Recall how to multiply a real number α by a 2D point (x, y) ∈R2: α(x, y) = (αx, αy).
Let A = R+ × R+, i.e. pairs of positive real numbers.
Deﬁne a relation ≫on A as follows:
(x, y) ≫(p, q) if and only if there exists a real number α ≥1 such that (x, y) = α(p, q).
Prove that ≫is antisymmetric.

2. (5 points) Recall that Z2 is the set of all pairs of integers. Let’s deﬁne the equivalence relation ∼
on Z2 as follows: (a, b) ∼(p, q) if and only aq = bp. List three members of [(5, 6)].
3. (5 points) Let T be the relation on R2 such that (x, y)T(p, q) if and only if (x, y) = α(p, q) for some
real number α. Is T symmetric? Informally explain why it is, or give a concrete counter-example
showing that it is not.
