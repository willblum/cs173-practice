      "Yes",
      "No"

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "No. Notice that every recursive rule adds exactly 2 characters to the string length (e.g. `aSa`, `bSb`), and the base cases terminate with exactly 1 character (`a` or `b`). This means every generated string will always have an odd total length. Therefore, it cannot generate even-length strings like 'aa' or 'ab'.",

    "explanation": "Review the parse trees. S requires either producing just 'a' (leaf), or grouping an internal 'N' bounded by 'a' and ('b' or 'c'). N requires generating exactly two 'S' branches or just 'd'. The top trees follow these rules properly.",
